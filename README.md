## Project Documentation: Data Pipeline with Apache Beam
This project involves creating a data pipeline using Apache Beam to generate fake social network tweets. The pipeline uses Google Cloud Pub/Sub to ingest data and stores the processed data in a BigQuery table. Additionally, the pipeline includes a flagging mechanism to identify dangerous words in the tweets.
